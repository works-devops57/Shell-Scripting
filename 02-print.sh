## Printing something on screen can be done by two commands
# 1. echo
# 2. printf

# printf will have more syntax to deal with print something on command window (More Complex)
# echo is more descriptive and yet does all the things that printf does ( Most Simple)

## Syntax: echo <MESSAGE TO PRINT>

echo Hello World!
